this is considered as a simple substitution for linux command-crontab. first we should echo lines of run message to ~/.run.conf, and then run the runstatus.py. The run.py is considered as a daemon which does nothing.When we run the second
program-runstatus.py, we will get what programs has been planned to be run or if it is excecuted or error.
